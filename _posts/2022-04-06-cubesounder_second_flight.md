CubeSounder Second Flight
=================

Second flight of the CubeSounder payload! After a challenging launch, the flight lasted for over 100 hours and we sucessfully demonstrated CubeSounder in stratospheric flight. This raises the TRL of our technology to TRL6, paving the way for future missions.
